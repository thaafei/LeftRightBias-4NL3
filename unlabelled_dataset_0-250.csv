It’s over.
The cable news networks loved it because they love a show but there was no real drama. Americans knew for months how this would turn out. They knew Democrats didn’t have the votes in the Senate. It was all about targeting select Republican senators in the next elections.

That changed when Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) became the first senator in American history to vote to convict a president of his own party.
The word commonly used to describe the virulent partisanship in our politics is “tribal.” But that unfairly disparages indigenous tribes around the world. The divisions have torn apart families and friends. In 2018, when Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) campaigned for reelection, six brothers and sisters attacked..."
230,Acquittal is not exoneration,"(CNN) - Despite the Trump White House's insistence that the President has been vindicated and exonerated by the Senate vote to not remove him from office, acquittal does not mean exoneration in an impeachment trial.
Trump's acquittal in the Senate was always a foregone conclusion. No American president has been removed from office as a result of a Senate trial. In their wisdom, the founders placed the bar at an appropriately high two-thirds.
Nonetheless, impeachment will be in the first paragraph of Trump's obituary. It puts him in a permanent..."

A more disappointing job report than had been forecast. Economic numbers weaker than expected. Just 96,000 jobs were created in August, far fewer than what economists were anticipating.
